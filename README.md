Simple repository to my study anotations about JavaScript Basics.
Course: Udemy - The complete JavaScript Course

## Anotations

### 1. Where can I write my JS?
  1. The first way is inside the script tag:
  ```javascript
  <script>
    console.log('Hellow World');
  </script>
  ```

  2. The second way is also with the script tag, but using the source to 
  link an external script file:
  ```javascript
  <script src="script.js"></script>
  ```

### 2. Variables and data types

How we declare a variable: 
```javascript
  var name = 'John';
```

There are 5 primitive data types:
```javascript
  Number: Floating point numbers, for decimals and integers
  String: Sequence of characters, used for texts
  Boolean: Logical types: true or false
  Undefined: Data type of a variable which does not have a value yet
  Null: Also means 'non-existent'
  ```

There are two types of comment in JavaScript:
```javascript
  // it's inline comment

  /*
    it is
    a block
    comment
  */
  ```
